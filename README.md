# Growth Hacking sentiment

This repo contains my solutions to Parts 1-4 of the Manning Live Project ["Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing for Marketing"](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/sentiment-analysis-and-natural-language-processing-for-marketing)


The project dates from 2020 and is based around the then state-of-the-art BERT series of LLMs. Things have moved on since then with the OpenAPI GPT 3.x and 4.x models and their competitors. It would be interesting to see how well GPT-4o or Llama 3.1-405B do on this task.
